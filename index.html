Welcome to my page! My name is Zhiqing Hong and I am a third-year master student majoring in computer science in Zhejiang University, China.
<br><br>
My research interests lie in the broad field of machine learning and data mining.
I have research experience in the application of machine learning in medical data analysis, 3-D image classification with convolutional neural network, affective 
computing through physiological signal.
I am always excited to share and communicate with others!
